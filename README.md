# Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system that utilizes collaborative filtering and gradient boosting models to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system uses the MovieLens dataset and is implemented using Python.

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The movie recommendation system provides personalized movie recommendations based on established user ratings. 

## Business Problem <a name="businessproblem"></a>
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) is a social media platform designed for users to track the movies they've watched, allowing them to quickly access their favorite films and share them with friends.

The platform is built around an designed for film sharing and community interaction. Movie recommendations are generated by the user's social connections and interactions within the platform. This community-based approach, though personal, results in users without friends on the Letterboxd platform missing out on receiving new recommendations. 

Introducing a recommendation system that leverages users' viewing and rating history could enhance the platform's value.

## Data Summary <a name="datasummary"></a>
This dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. 

It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

## Project Elements <a name="projectelements"></a>
- Predict movie ratings using collaborative filtering
- Enhance predictions with gradient boosting models
- Feature engineering to create meaningful user-movie interaction features
- Generate movie recommendations based on cosine similarity of movie features

### Collaborative Filtering Models <a name="collaborativefiltering"></a>
Collaborative filtering is a technique used to predict user preferences based on past interactions. It identifies patterns in user behavior and recommends items that similar users have liked. 

In this project, Simon Funk's Singular Value Decomposition (Funk's SVD) from the surprise library is used. Funk's SVD decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, capturing the underlying relationships between users and movies. This allows us to predict ratings for movies that a user has not yet seen.

### Boosting Models <a name="boosting"></a>
Gradient boosting models are powerful machine learning algorithms used for regression and classification tasks. 

In this project, gradient boosting is used to improve the initial predictions made by the collaborative filtering model. The residuals (differences between the actual and predicted ratings) from the Funk's SVD model are used as the target variable for the gradient boosting model. 

By training on these residuals, the gradient boosting model learns to correct the errors made by the Funk's SVD model, which improves the evaluation metric (Root Mean Squared Error).

The boosting models used are:

- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost
- XGBoost

#### Feature Engineering <a name="featureengineering"></a>
Feature engineering is performed to create additional features that enhance the predictive power of the boosted models. Features include:

- Movie Rating Count
	- The amount of ratings each movie has using the entire user base. 
- Average User Rating
	- Get the average of all the movies rated by each user.
- User Rating Count
	- The amount of movies rated by each user.
- User-Movie Rating Count Ratio
	- The users rating count divided by the movie rating count. 
	- This gives an indication of how active the user is in comparison to the rest of the user base. 

### Cosine Similarity <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
Cosine similarity is used to find movies similar to a user's top-rated movies. This similarity measure helps in generating recommendations that align with the user's preferences.
